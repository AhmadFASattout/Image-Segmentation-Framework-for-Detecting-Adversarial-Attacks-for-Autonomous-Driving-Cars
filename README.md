# Image-Segmentation-Framework-for-Detecting-Adversarial-Attacks-for-Autonomous-Driving-Cars
This is a GitHub implementaion of our paper titled "Image Segmentation Framework for Detecting Adversarial Attacks for Autonomous Driving Cars".

# The Goal of this GitHub:
* To let the researchers reproduce the same results of our paper.
* The development of more advance adversarial detection method based on our upadted code and framework will be easier and faster.


Generating Adversrail attacks was based one **Feature Squeezing** code with updating the code to work using Python 3.6. Please

**Feature Squeezing**

## 1. Install dependencies.

Please install all the required Python packeges from the Yaml files and create two different environments.
spd_adv_env.Yaml representing the required python packages to run eleven Attacks on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB-8 datasets.
tensorenv_adv_env.Yaml representing the required python packages to run our adversarial detection framework.
